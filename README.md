# Module4Challenge-CodingQuiz
This is for Week 4's coding challenge for UCF's Coding Bootcamp (Part-Time October 2022) where we were tasked with creating a simple Coding Quiz that would provide HTML/CSS/JavaScript coding questions to the user, the user's score would be based on a timer with the time reducing for every incorrect answer, and the user would be able to see personal high scores using the local storage from the browser.

## Description
This coding quiz has __ coding questions. When the user presses the "Start Quiz" button, they will be presented with the first question. Every question they answer will display the next question until the end of the quiz. <br>

Once the quiz is over, the user will have the option to save their score, inputting their initials. The user will be prompted whether they want to overwrite their previous score or not if they've used the same initials previously. <br>

Clicking on the "View Scores" link will display all of the previous scores and initials that the user has saved. Since this is using local storage, it only saves scores that the user has saved locally on their current browswer. The user has the option to clear these scores, which clears the entire local storage. <br>
